# mdq-server-nagios

Nagios plugin to provide monitoring of [mdq-server](https://github.com/iay/mdq-server) instances.

## Prerequisites

The script uses a number of Perl modules. Most of them should already be installed on a system
running Nagios, but `Monitoring::Plugin` may need to be acquired separately. If you are running on
a RHEL-derived system with EPEL available, you can use `yum install perl-Monitoring-Plugin`.

## Testing and Installing

To find out if the script will run on your system, you can invoke it against some of the
provided data files:

    $ ./check_mda_health -u test/up.json
    MDQ_HEALTH OK - status is UP
    $ ./check_mdq_health -u file:test/down.json
    MDQ_HEALTH CRITICAL - status is DOWN
    $ ./check_mdq_health -u file:test/degraded.json
    MDQ_HEALTH WARNING - status is DEGRADED

If everything seems fine, copy `check_mda_health` into the directory where your other Nagios
plugins live. This is normally defined as `$USER1$` in `/etc/nagios/private/resource.cfg`
as something like `/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins`.

You can then define a command based on this plugin in one of your configuration files as follows:

    define command {
        command_name    check_mdq_health
        command_line    $USER1$/check_mdq_health --url $ARG1$ $ARG2$
    }

A service check then looks like this:

    define service {
        use                   my-service-template
        host_name             mdq
        service_description   health
        check_command         check_mdq_health!http://mdq.example.org/health
    }
